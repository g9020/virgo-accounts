# Virgo Accounts

Virgo Accounts is a DOS-based accounts system designed for solicitors in England and Wales, also suitable for lawyers in other jurisdictions, and for other professionals.

The system is written in DataTree MUMPS (DTM-PC v4.3) and contains around 140 routines. The source code (routines and globals) will shortly be available to anyone who wishes to port the system to a more up-to-date version of MUMPS/M on Windows, Linux or any other operting system.
